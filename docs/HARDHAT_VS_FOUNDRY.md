# Hardhat vs Foundry - Tool Selection Assessment

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Decision Point:** Which development framework to use for OmniVault

---

## 🎁 HARDHAT PRIZE CONSIDERATIONS

### **Typical Hardhat Prize Requirements:**

Based on previous ETHGlobal hackathons, Hardhat prizes usually require:

1. **Use Hardhat for development**
   - `hardhat.config.ts`
   - Hardhat test suite
   - Hardhat scripts for deployment

2. **Demonstrate Hardhat features**
   - Testing (chai + ethers)
   - Deployment scripts
   - Contract verification
   - Network configuration

3. **Prize Amount:** Typically $1,000-$2,500

### **What's New in Hardhat 3.0:**
- Better TypeScript support
- Improved testing experience
- Viem integration (alternative to ethers)
- Better plugin system
- EDR (Ethereum Development Runtime) - faster

## 🎯 ASSESSMENT FOR OMNIVAULT

### **Project Requirements:**

1. **Smart Contracts:**
   - ERC-7540 vault (complex)
   - Operator pattern
   - Mock strategy
   - Integration with USDC

2. **Testing Needs:**
   - Unit tests (deposit/redeem flow)
   - Operator authorization tests
   - Integration tests
   - Edge cases

3. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy to Sepolia
   - Verify contracts
   - Set up operator

### **Time Estimates:**

**With Foundry (Your Current Path):**
- Setup: ✅ Already done (5 min)
- Contract development: 2-3 hours
- Tests: 1 hour
- Deployment: 30 min
- **Total: 3.5-4.5 hours**

**With Hardhat:**
- Setup: 30-45 min (new)
- Contract development: 2-3 hours (same)
- Tests: 1.5 hours (slower, JS)
- Deployment: 30 min
- **Total: 4.5-5.5 hours**

**Difference: +1 hour with Hardhat**

## 💰 PRIZE ANALYSIS

### **Hardhat Prize:**
- **Potential:** $1,000-$2,500
- **Probability:** Medium (need good Hardhat usage)
- **Time Cost:** +1 hour

### **Current Prize Strategy:**
- **Avail:** $5,000-$10,000 (high probability)
- **Circle:** $1,000-$2,500 (medium probability)
- **Blockscout:** $500-$1,000 (low, already using)

### **Adding Hardhat:**
- **New Total Potential:** $7,500-$16,500
- **Time Investment:** +1 hour
- **Risk:** Dilutes focus from core functionality

---

## 🤔 DECISION FACTORS

### **Arguments FOR Hardhat:**

1. ✅ **Additional Prize:** $1-2.5k opportunity
2. ✅ **Diversification:** More prize shots
3. ✅ **Good for Frontend:** Easier TypeScript integration
4. ✅ **Industry Standard:** More widely used

### **Arguments AGAINST Hardhat:**

1. ❌ **Time Cost:** +1 hour (15-20% overhead)
2. ❌ **Context Switch:** Already started with Foundry
3. ❌ **Slower Tests:** JavaScript-based testing slower
4. ❌ **Risk:** Taking time from core features
5. ❌ **Foundry Advantage:** You're already set up!

---

## 💡 HYBRID APPROACH?

### **Option: Foundry for Dev, Hardhat for Tests**

**Possible but complex:**
```
Contracts: Written in Foundry
Core Tests: Foundry (fast)
Integration Tests: Hardhat (for prize)
Deployment: Either
```

**Assessment:** ⚠️ Not worth complexity for hackathon

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

### **STICK WITH FOUNDRY** ⭐

**Why:**

1. **Already Set Up** ✅
   - You've already run `forge init`
   - OpenZeppelin installation ready
   - No context switch needed

2. **Time is Critical** ⏱️
   - 6-9 hours for MVP
   - +1 hour = 14-17% overhead
   - Better spent on core features or polish

3. **Foundry is Better for This Project** 🚀
   - Faster testing (Solidity tests)
   - Better for complex contracts
   - Built-in fuzzing
   - You're more familiar

4. **Prize Math** 💰
   ```
   Avail Prize (likely): $5-10k
   + Circle (possible): $1-2.5k
   + Hardhat (possible): $1-2.5k
   = Too many targets, risk spreading thin
   
   Better: NAIL Avail + Circle
   = Higher chance of winning primary prizes
   ```

5. **Quality > Quantity** ✨
   - Better to have ONE excellent demo
   - Than multiple "okay" integrations
   - Judges prefer depth over breadth

### **When Hardhat WOULD Make Sense:**

- ⏳ If you finish vault+frontend with 4+ hours to spare
- ⏳ If Hardhat is explicitly required for major prize
- ⏳ If you need advanced JavaScript integration tests

---

## ✅ FINAL DECISION

### **USE FOUNDRY**

**Plan:**
1. ✅ Continue with Foundry (already initialized)
2. ✅ Write contracts in Solidity
3. ✅ Write tests in Solidity (faster)
4. ✅ Deploy with Foundry scripts
5. ⏳ IF extra time at end: Add Hardhat tests (bonus)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Faster development
- ✅ No context switch
- ✅ Better testing experience
- ✅ Focus on core prizes (Avail + Circle)

**Trade-off:**
- ❌ Miss potential $1-2.5k Hardhat prize
- ✅ BUT: Better chance at $5-12.5k primary prizes

---

## 📊 TIME ALLOCATION

**Without Hardhat (Recommended):**
```
Contracts: 2-3 hours
Tests: 1 hour
Deploy: 0.5 hour
Frontend: 2-3 hours
Polish: 1 hour
Buffer: 1 hour
Total: 7.5-9.5 hours ✅ Realistic
```

**With Hardhat:**
```
Hardhat Setup: 0.5 hour
Contracts: 2-3 hours
Tests (Hardhat): 1.5 hours
Deploy: 0.5 hour
Frontend: 2-3 hours
Polish: 0.5 hour
Total: 7.5-10.5 hours ⚠️ Tight
```

---

## 🎯 ACTION

**PROCEED WITH FOUNDRY** 

- Install OpenZeppelin contracts
- Write OmniVault.sol
- Write tests
- Deploy to Sepolia
- Focus on making Avail integration AMAZING

**If time permits later:**
- Add Hardhat config
- Port some tests to Hardhat
- Mention Hardhat in submission

---

**Conclusion:** Foundry is the right choice for speed, quality, and focus. Stick with it! 🚀
