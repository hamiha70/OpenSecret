# Operator Bot Demo Guide

## Overview

The AsyncVault frontend now has a **toggle button** to switch between two claiming modes:

1. **üë§ Self-Claim Mode (Bot Disabled)** - User approves each claim transaction in MetaMask
2. **ü§ñ Operator Bot Mode (Bot Enabled)** - Backend bot automatically claims without user interaction

This allows you to **demonstrate both flows** to judges during the hackathon!

---

## UI Changes

### New Toggle Button

After connecting your wallet, you'll see a new section:

```
ü§ñ Operator Bot Mode
[‚≠ï Bot Disabled] ‚Üê Click to toggle
```

**When Enabled:**
- Button turns purple: `‚úÖ Bot Enabled`
- Shows note: "Make sure the operator bot is running"
- Deposit/Redeem won't trigger MetaMask popups for claims
- Bot handles everything automatically

**When Disabled:**
- Button is gray: `‚≠ï Bot Disabled`
- Deposit/Redeem will show MetaMask popups for claims
- Frontend polls and you approve manually

---

## Testing Both Modes

### Mode 1: Self-Claim (Bot Disabled - Default)

**Demo Flow:**
1. Connect wallet
2. Keep bot toggle **disabled** (‚≠ï)
3. Deposit 0.1 USDC
4. **Approve transaction 1:** Request Deposit
5. Wait 3 seconds for polling
6. **Approve transaction 2:** Claim Deposit (MetaMask popup)
7. Shares minted!

**Key Points for Judges:**
- "ERC-7540 is a 2-step asynchronous flow"
- "User has full control but needs to approve twice"
- "This is the safe, user-controlled approach"

### Mode 2: Operator Bot (Bot Enabled)

**Demo Flow:**
1. Start the operator bot:
   ```bash
   cd operator-bot
   npm install  # First time only
   npm start
   ```
2. In frontend, toggle bot **ON** (‚úÖ Bot Enabled)
3. Deposit 0.1 USDC
4. **Approve transaction 1 ONLY:** Request Deposit
5. **No second popup!** Bot claims automatically
6. Shares minted!

**Key Points for Judges:**
- "Operator bot monitors the blockchain for pending requests"
- "Claims automatically within 3-5 seconds"
- "User only approves ONCE - much better UX!"
- "Bot is trustless - can only claim, not steal funds"
- "Perfect for production DeFi where users expect instant execution"

## Operator Bot Output

When bot is running and detects a deposit:

```
üîî NEW DEPOSIT REQUEST
   User: 0x36AB88fDd34848C0caF4599736a9D3a860D051Ba
   Amount: 0.1 USDC
   Block: 9480100

üí∞ [0x36AB88f...] Pending deposit: 0.1 USDC
‚è≥ [0x36AB88f...] Claiming deposit...
üì§ [0x36AB88f...] Tx sent: 0xabc123...
‚úÖ [0x36AB88f...] Deposit claimed! Block: 9480105
```

**Show this terminal to judges** alongside the frontend!

## Architecture Comparison

### Without Operator Bot
```
User ‚Üí MetaMask (Request) ‚Üí Vault ‚Üí User ‚Üí MetaMask (Claim) ‚Üí Vault
      ‚úÖ Approved                    ‚úÖ Approved
      
Total User Actions: 2 MetaMask approvals
Time: ~30 seconds (waiting for user to approve claim)
```

### With Operator Bot
```
User ‚Üí MetaMask (Request) ‚Üí Vault
      ‚úÖ Approved              
                                ‚Üì
                            Operator Bot ‚Üí Vault (auto-claim)
                            ü§ñ No user action needed
                            
Total User Actions: 1 MetaMask approval
Time: ~15 seconds (bot claims immediately)
```

## Demo Script for Judges

### Opening (30 seconds)
"We built AsyncVault, an ERC-7540 compliant vault with an innovative operator pattern for UX optimization."

### Self-Claim Demo (1 minute)
1. Show toggle disabled
2. Deposit 0.1 USDC
3. Approve request
4. Wait for claim popup
5. "As you can see, ERC-7540 requires two steps. The user has to wait and approve twice."

### Operator Bot Demo (1 minute)
1. Enable toggle
2. Show bot terminal running
3. Deposit 0.1 USDC
4. Approve request ONLY
5. Point to bot terminal claiming
6. "Notice - no second popup! The operator bot claimed automatically within 3 seconds."

### Technical Deep Dive (1 minute)
- "The operator is a trusted EOA that can call `claimDepositFor(user)`"
- "It monitors events and pending requests in parallel"
- "Users still control their funds - bot only executes the claim they already requested"
- "This pattern solves the UX problem of async vaults"

## Parallel User Testing

The operator bot handles **multiple users simultaneously**:

### Test Scenario

1. **User A:** Enable bot, deposit 1 USDC
2. **User B:** Enable bot, deposit 2 USDC  
3. **User C:** Enable bot, deposit 0.5 USDC

**Bot Output:**
```
üîÑ Checking 3 users for pending claims...

üí∞ [0x36AB88f...] (User A) Pending deposit: 1.0 USDC
üí∞ [0x7EC14a7...] (User B) Pending deposit: 2.0 USDC
üí∞ [0x9660cd2...] (User C) Pending deposit: 0.5 USDC

‚è≥ Processing all claims in parallel...

‚úÖ [0x36AB88f...] Deposit claimed! Block: 9480105
‚úÖ [0x7EC14a7...] Deposit claimed! Block: 9480105
‚úÖ [0x9660cd2...] Deposit claimed! Block: 9480106
```

All 3 users get their shares within seconds!

## Prize Angle

### Avail Prize
- "We use Avail Nexus for cross-chain user onboarding"
- "Users can bridge USDC from any chain to deposit into our vault"

### Circle Prize  
- "USDC is our primary asset"
- "All profits and losses are settled in USDC"

### Innovation
- "We solved the ERC-7540 UX problem with the operator pattern"
- "Toggle allows users to choose between full control vs convenience"
- "Production-ready for mainnet deployment"

## Common Questions

**Q: Is the operator bot trustworthy?**  
A: The operator can only execute claims that users already requested. It cannot steal funds or change redemption amounts.

**Q: What if the bot goes offline?**  
A: Users can always self-claim by disabling the bot toggle. The contract supports both modes.

**Q: Does the bot work with multiple users?**  
A: Yes! It processes all pending requests in parallel every 5 seconds.

**Q: How much does it cost to run?**  
A: ~0.0001 ETH per claim on Sepolia. On mainnet with optimizations, <$0.10 per claim.

## Next Steps After Demo

1. **Market Simulator Bot** - Generates profit/loss to show share price changes
2. **AWS Deployment** - Production-ready infrastructure  
3. **Envio Indexer** - Real-time dashboard with historical data
